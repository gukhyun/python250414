Jade Garden,4.4,N/A,Surprisingly authentic cooking by a Japanese chef of Chinese dishes.  We loved almost every single dish apart from the shrimp dish which imo is intended for non-Chinese taste.  Good service but they close their kitchen very early at 8 pm already.,"2-chōme-7-2 Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku City",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJR3s9zSrzGGARp32UICZCSTM

Duo Fourchettes,4.1,3,"European Restaurant - Yet another restaurant in Japan that is high on presentation, above average in taste but very heavy on your pockets.

Godaigo Shinjuku NS Building,3.9,2,"Dark ambiance inside and good food.  We had the oden, which i think is the main reason to come here.

I liked the egg jelly and eggplant dishes.  The salad and potato salad were both standard, and I enjoyed the flavorful yakiniku.

This would be a good place to come with a group, prices are reasonable and its a convenient location close to the Tokyo government buildings and shinjuku.","新宿 NS ビル ２９F, 2-chōme-4−１ Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku City",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJXQ4NntOMGGAR6KWamA18A-o

each meal includes soba tea.","2-chōme-1-1 Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku City",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJq2juqNWMGGARRX5OJMENYHY
Watanabe Soba,4.1,2,"This was a nice meal, I had the tempura soba & the portions they give are quite substantial considering the price and compared to other soba restaurants. The soba is slightly thinner than i am used to, not so much a square in the cross section as it might be considered rectangular. You can see them making it in shop.

Service was very good and they serve your food very quickly!","八洋ビル, 1-chōme-12−１０ Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku City",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJ2xj2RdGMGGARNAfVn_4178Y

Fumotoya Keio Plaza Hotel,3.8,2,"A bit difficult to find as you can’t get to it from inside the hotel. You have to access from the outside. Food was good as expected for this level of restaurant. We had dinner sets which included 6 or 7 courses. We also tried a Japanese white wine which was quite refreshing. Our server spoke some English and was trying hard to serve us well. The atmosphere was quaint and peaceful, maybe because it wasn’t a busy night. Overall we had a great dining experience there.","2-chōme-2-1 Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku City",https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJ4WIcdNSMGGARSoKIrKx2CC4
